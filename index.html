			<p>The animal known as a "panther" actually refers to 3 different types of big cats, leopards (Panthera pardus) or jaguars (Panthera onca) that have a black or white color mutation and a subspecies of the cougar (Puma concolor). The "black panther" is a black jaguar of the Americas or a black leopard of Asia and Africa </p>
